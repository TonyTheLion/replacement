# Template Examples Directory

Each `.yaml` template file in [this Examples directory](./)
	has a corresponding `.out` file giving the expected output.

Any other files are static input for one or more templates.

All examples from the [project documentation](../README.md) should show
	the file path in this directory as a comment and be kept synchronized.

- These examples double as test cases.
- Any test case should have an example in this directory.
- Examples which are not referenced and explained else where in the
	documentation should have a section in this document.
